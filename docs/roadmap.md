# Archimedes – Development Roadmap

> **Version**: 1.0.0  
> **Created**: 2026-01-04  
> **Target Completion**: Week 20 (MVP with integrations)

---

## Overview

Archimedes is the async HTTP/gRPC server framework for the Themis Platform. **Archimedes core can be developed in parallel** with Themis and Eunomia using mock contracts and policies.

### Parallel Development Strategy

```
Week 1: Shared Types (COORDINATION - themis-platform-types)
    ↓
Week 2-4: Core Framework (PARALLEL - uses shared types)
    ↓
Week 5-8: Server & Routing (PARALLEL - mock contracts)
    ↓
Week 9-12: Middleware Pipeline (PARALLEL - mock validation)
    ↓
Week 13-16: Observability & Config (PARALLEL)
    ↓
Week 17-20: Integration (AFTER Themis/Eunomia ready)
```

## Phase A0: Shared Platform Types (Week 1) ⭐ COORDINATION

> **Note**: The `themis-platform-types` crate is created by Themis team in Week 1.
> Archimedes integrates it to ensure schema compatibility with Eunomia.

### Week 1: Integrate Shared Types

> ⚠️ **Note (2026-01-04)**: `themis-platform-types` crate not yet available.
> Proceeding with local type definitions that will be migrated to shared types later.
> Local types are designed to match the integration spec for easy migration.

  > Supports SPIFFE, User, ApiKey, Anonymous variants per spec.
- [ ] Use shared `PolicyInput` for OPA evaluation
  > 🔄 **Deferred**: To be implemented in Phase A3 (middleware)
- [ ] Use shared `PolicyDecision` from OPA response
  > 🔄 **Deferred**: To be implemented in Phase A3 (middleware)
- [x] Use shared `ThemisErrorEnvelope` for error responses

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

1. **Hyper Complexity**

   - _Mitigation_: Start simple, add features incrementally

2. **OPA Integration**

   - _Mitigation_: Use OPA CLI first, then native integration

3. **Performance**
   - _Mitigation_: Benchmark early, optimize incrementally

### Schedule Risks

1. **Themis/Eunomia Delays**

   - _Mitigation_: 16 weeks of work is independent
   - Only 4 weeks blocked on integration

2. **Integration Complexity**
   - _Mitigation_: Define interfaces early, use mocks
