# Requirements for Python Native Example
#
# Note: The main dependency is the archimedes native extension,
# which is built from crates/archimedes-py using maturin.
#
# For development:
#   cd crates/archimedes-py
#   pip install maturin
#   maturin develop
#
# The native extension provides:
# - App: Application instance
# - Config: Configuration loader  
# - Response: HTTP response builder
# - RequestContext: Request metadata and identity
# - ArchimedesError: Error type

# Development dependencies
maturin>=1.5
pytest>=7.0
pytest-asyncio>=0.21

# Optional: for local testing without full Archimedes
# (remove once archimedes wheel is available)
